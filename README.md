Homework 5 -- Work Day Scheduler

DESCRIPTION
A simple, one-day work scheduler. Users can see the current day printed at the top of the page. Information can be entered into each input box and saved by clicking the icon on the right side of that box. Information is saved in local storage and persists when the page is loaded and refreshed. Users will be able to see, by color, which hours have already passed (grey), which hour it is currently (red), and which hours are still in the future (green).

TECHNOLOGIES
Built in Visual Studio using HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, jQuery, Font Awesome, Moment.js

ASSESSMENT
Building out the HTML and general styling of this page was very simple, as was assigning button handlers and setting up local storage. It was much more challenging to figure out how to get the colors to appear correctly due to issues presented by using a 12-hour model versus a 24-hour/military model of time.
